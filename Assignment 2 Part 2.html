    <ul>
      <li> Page Title: Yes, easy to understand.</li>
      <li> Image Alternative text is present. </li>
      <li> All text on the website is readable, there is a switch to make the text bigger-smaller. </li>
      <li> Interaction is possible, all forms work and look clear. </li>
      <li> Two noscript elements are present, that can prevent some users from seeing the content. </li>
      <li> One YouTube video is embed. </li>
    </ul>

    <p> Overall, the website does not have any errors and does a great job for helpong kids and their families to use the offered resources. But the YouTube that is linked can cause some troubles, as this servise auto-modify captions and subtitles, unless you spesifically uploaded new ones. This moment has to be monitored. Also, The giant picture on the front page on the background takes too much attention, I would place something more calm there. </p>
